+ think more about working withd data base. For example we can have one data base "curview.md"
  and different tables with years. Or wwe can have data base with numerues of year "2020"
  and tables with different currency dollar, bitcoin and e.t.c.
- think more about message in wwdb.py in wwdb(). Maybe will better put it in funcion?
